- What is methods?
- Structure of a method (modifier, argument(s), return value)
- Defining a method
- Calliing a method (call stack) (execution flow of a method and main)
- Return types : void and others (what do I do with the return value?)
- pass by value VS pass by reference
- The scope of variables
- Modularizing
- General design : top down design and implementation
