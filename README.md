 - What is method?
#### 5. Public VS Private

#### size()

Just like with an `ArrayList`, you can get the size of a `HashMap` by calling the method `size`.

> **Exercise:** Modify your program to tell the user how many words they input.

# Structures of this session

This session is 4 hours long.



We'll be using NYC Open Data again to build a `HashMap` of [restaurant data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59). Use [`FileParser`](in-class%20exercise%20solutions/RestaurantFacts/FileParser.java) to get an `ArrayList` representing the lines in the file and follow [this stencil file](in-class%20exercise%20solutions/RestaurantFacts/RestaurantFacts.java).

Here's a simple program execution:

```
Name a restaurant:
MORRIS PARK BAKE SHOP
A
```

#### Bonus
> Modify your `HashMap` of `String`s to hold an `ArrayList` of `String`s. When the user inputs a restaurant name, print all the relevant facts that you have.

# Things to do before coming to this session
