# Personality of this session

- We will not go over for homeworks
- We will just focus on getting the concepts.
- Don't think about getting the right answers or solving the problems. just focus on understanding and getting the concepts.
- For the first 3 hours, we will learn with papers and a white board to visualize the concepts and class & methods structures.
- Visualizing your mind and the structure is the most important. You need papers!
- Again, we will NOT go over for homeworks LOL period
